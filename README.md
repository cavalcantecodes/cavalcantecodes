# 🚀 CyberCavalcante

## A Glimpse Into My World
🖥️ From '90s tech beginnings, my fascination with the digital realm has only deepened.  
🔍 Cybersecurity isn't just a field; it's my calling. I particularly revel in offensive security and unearthing vulnerabilities.  
🌐 With SecureAxis, I've channeled my passion to reshape how we see and practice cybersecurity.

## Tracing My Steps
- 💾 Kicked off with a trusty Gateway computer; by 14, coding was my new playground.
- 🛡️ My 6-year rendezvous with Bug Bounty Hunting has yielded over 100+ identified vulnerabilities.
- 📚 The tech world evolves. So do I. Forever a learner and eager sharer in the vast sea of cybersecurity.
