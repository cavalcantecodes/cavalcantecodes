# Hey, I'm Michael DeCavalcante! 👋

## Dive into My World 🌐
🔍 I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity, especially when it's about offensive security and exploiting vulnerabilities.  
🖥️ My tech journey took flight in the 90s, and I've been submerged in the intriguing depths of cybersecurity ever since.
